# Pong-game-on-RISC-V-with-VGA
This repository belongs to the Mini Project of Max Berglund and Milla Gradin for the KTH course IS1500.

# Description
This repository contains a two-player Pong game written in C-code which can be run on a RISC-V board with a VGA output. The outer switches on the RISC-V board are used to control the player paddles, while other switches can be used to alter the game in different ways such as making the ball move at different speeds or making the paddles behave differently. A player increases their score by making the ball touch the border behind their opponent, and the game ends when a player reaches a certain score. The push button can be used to restart the game.
